# Cour-Des-Comptes
The Paris Summer Innovation Fellowship gathered 20 data scientists, urban hackers and designers to take on a project for social good during 2 weeks.

I have worked with open text data from Cour des Comptes, and the project consisted in scoring all french administrations using the reports written by the institution.
